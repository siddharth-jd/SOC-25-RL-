# Week 1:
In the first week I have learned the concepts of python basics, pygame and created an snake game from the learnings.I have attatched the snake game code in week 1 folder.

# Week 2:
In week 2 I have learned the fundamentals of neural networks and CNNs. Practiced with TensorFlow Playground, PyTorch tutorials, and explored transfer learning techniques.From which I have trained the mnist data.I have attatched the related code, report and graphs(plots) in week 2 folder.

# Week 3:
In week 3 I learned key RL concepts like MDPs, value functions, and Bellman equations, and explored how model-based methods differ from model-free ones. I also studied policy iteration and value iteration approaches.

# Week 4:
In week 4 I deepened my understanding of reinforcement learning by exploring Q-learning and Deep Q Networks (DQNs). I learned how Q-learning works in gridworld environments and studied key DQN techniques like experience replay and target networks, along with the shift from tabular methods to function approximation.
